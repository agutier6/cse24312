The order of compilation and files to understand the design is as follows:


-------------------------------------------------

Command 1 - make fib

Files: fib.cpp

Slides: 16-19

fib.cpp contains a recursive implementation of computing the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence. The slides show the drawback to this approach, which is when excessive calls are made on the stack
